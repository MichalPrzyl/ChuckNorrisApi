# Chuck Norris Api #

In this project I am using React to render a simple site with Chuck Norris quotes. 
After every button click you will get a different quote.
Basically I am using the simplest API (I think), and it's Chuck Norris Api.
You can learn more about it here:

In my first job interview I said that I have never done any app in React.js but I am quick learner so my employer wanted to test it out. A couple hours later he get this project.
